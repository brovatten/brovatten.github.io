I love learning about machine learning in different disciplines. I am currently working at [Bank for International Settlements](https://www.bis.org/) (BIS) as a Data Scientist in the financial domain. Prior, I worked at the startup [liom](https://liom.com/) as a `Machine Learning Research Scientist Intern` in the domain of signal processing-based methods to identify glucose in blood using non-linear models.

In my free-time I like to do any `sports`. I am an amateur runner, planning my third marathon in Zurich 2025. I like learning about new things, travelling to other continents, and watch comedy movies.

I am always looking for new research projects or open-source projects to contribute to in my free-time. So if you want to collaborate, `please reach out`!
