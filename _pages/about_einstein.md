I love learning about machine learning in different disciplines. I am currently working at Bank for International Settlements (BIS) as a Data Scientist Contractor in the financial domain. Prior, I worked at the startup [liom](liom.com) as a `Machine Learning Research Scientist Intern` in the domain of spectroscopy-based methods to identify glucose in-vitro. 

In my free-time I like to do any `sports`. I am an amateur runner, planning my third marathon in Zurich 2025. I like learning about new things, travelling to other continents, and comedy movies.

I am always looking for new research projects or open-source projects to contribute to in my free-time. So if you want to collaborate, `please reach out`!
